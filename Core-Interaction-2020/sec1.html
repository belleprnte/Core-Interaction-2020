      My name is Isabella Parente and I am a sophmore in Communication Design at Parsons School of Design. I'm 19 years old and from New York. <br> <br>
      I am also minoring in Photography at Parsons. I would say I enjoy taking photographs way more than coding, but I would also like having money in the future.
